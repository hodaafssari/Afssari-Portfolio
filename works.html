                        <p>When we dream, we access a space opposite of reality. Anything can happen, and nothing is impossible. Dreams connect irrelevant things in mysterious, unexplainable ways.</p>
                        <p>The project uses pastel colors, relaxing sounds, and interconnected landscapes to create a comfortable dream world that visitors can physically interact with through virtual space. Each element works together to create either a happy, comfortable atmosphere or, to others, a potential nightmare.</p>
                        <p>Purpose: To create connection and interaction with dream spaces, and to provide a relaxing environment where visitors can explore and make their own connections in ways only they can understand.</p>

                        <p>There is continuous Muslim misrepresentation in the media sending out the wrong message about Muslims which has disastrous consequences. Muslim characters in the media are commonly either presented as violent, oppressed, or as a terrorist.</p>
                        <p>America claims to be living in a progressive time but the lack of accurate Muslim representation says otherwise. It is not accurate and often shows a misappropriating and offensive storyline. They are rarely in stories that represent them authentically.</p>
                        <p>This piece challenges these stereotypes and calls for more authentic representation in both fiction and nonfiction media.</p>

                        <p>This piece remodels an existing 3D wizard hat, conceptually and physically transforming its meaning. While the original object resembled the sorting hat from Harry Potter - an object that definitively tells you who you are - this reimagining incorporates a butterfly as a symbol of growth and change.</p>
                        <p>The overall concept evolved from a deterministic view of identity to one that embraces personal growth and self-determination. It represents how no one or nothing can truly define who you are, as you have the power to grow and change.</p>

                        <p>Using data moshing techniques, this piece transforms pre-existing images into glitch art that represents the feeling of being overwhelmed and burnt out. The distorted images mirror how one might feel when overwhelmed - not functioning as intended, like a system experiencing glitches.</p>
                        <p>The work draws a parallel between technical glitches and human experiences of burnout, suggesting that sometimes when we don't function as "intended," we can create something unexpected and beautiful. It's a reflection on how our perceived malfunctions can lead to unique and valuable outcomes.</p>
                        <p>This piece serves as both a visualization of mental exhaustion and a reminder that even in our "glitched" states, we can produce something meaningful and transformative.</p>

                        <p>This interactive piece resurrects a character from my elementary and middle school doodles - a simple figure made of basic geometric shapes that once provided comfort during idle moments. The recreation serves as a bridge to simpler times, embodying a deep sense of nostalgia.</p>
                        <p>The black square framing the face represents both the hijab and a metaphor for how society attempts to confine Muslim identity within stereotypical boundaries, failing to recognize its dynamic nature. The design incorporates several interactive elements:</p>

                            <p>• A mouth that responds to microphone input</p>

                            <p>• A smaller circle that randomly selects positions and shades, symbolizing mental "glitches"</p>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Through these interactive elements, the piece explores themes of identity, control, and the complexity of navigating between past simplicity and present reality.</p>
